# About this site

This site collects **notes, summaries, and interpretations**
from my own reading of books, articles, and historical material
related to Okinawan karate.

## Why this format?

Markdown allows:

- Fast writing
- Easy linking between concepts
- Clear separation of content and presentation

The layout is intentionally simple and restrained.

> The goal is not authority, but clarity.

## Sources

Where possible, references are listed explicitly.
Absence of a citation does **not** imply certainty.

## Contact / feedback

Corrections or suggestions are welcome via GitHub issues.
